### Week 1-2

Hi and welcome to my blog! This is where I’ll keep all the documentation from my Creative Coding journey.   
This week we were introduced to the p5 editor (first time for me!) and its basics.  

I learnt how p5 is set up and how to make simple shapes:
<iframe width=400 height=442 style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" src="https://editor.p5js.org/elishafitri/full/htrJ3R_vq"></iframe>

What I learnt:
- `function setup ( )` is for defining environment properties (such as canvas size and bg colour), which will only run once
- `function draw ( )` is for the main part of the sketch, which automatically runs next and will continually loop  at around 60 frames per second

When we were given the task to explore p5 on our own and create a square in the middle, I originally tried placing the square in the setup function and the global scope- when this didn’t work, we found that it could only execute within the scope of the draw function.
