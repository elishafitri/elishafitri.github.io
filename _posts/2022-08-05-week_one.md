### Week One

Today we were introduced to p5 (first time for me!) and its basics.

What I learnt:
- `function setup ( )` is for defining environment properties (such as canvas size and bg colour), which will only run once
- `function draw ( )` is for the main part of the sketch, which automatically runs next and will continually loop  at around 60 frames per second

When we were given the task to explore p5 on our own and create a square in the middle, I originally tried placing the square in the setup function and the global scope- when this didnâ€™t work, we found that it could only execute within the scope of the draw function.
