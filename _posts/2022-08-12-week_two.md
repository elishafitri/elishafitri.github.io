## W2-3

This week, we looked at more p5 topics. Iâ€™m starting to feel more familiar with the structure. And I made a square go up!

I learnt how to declare a variable and use an if statement to create a boundary for the moving square. When the y-position of the square reaches -100px on the screen (fully disappears), the y-position moves to the bottom of the screen to start moving up again. 

### Learning p5 Topics: key takeaways
  
#### frameCount & noLoop
- count always start at zero
- the frame is only counted once in the set up function because it only loads once. However, it will keep looping in the draw function.
- `noLoop` stops the code from continuously looping
  
#### variables 
- `Let` is a reassignable variable, while `const` is a variable that is immutable
- back ticks allow us to directly call a variable using `${...}`
    
#### colour

#### print & log
- `print(msg)` will print a message in the console where `const msg = "..."` is defined
- better to use `console.log ( )` as the above only works in set up or draw functions and NOT in the global scope (otherwise the computer will literally try and print the page!)
  
#### noise & random
- random: generates an unexpected number in a specified range
- noise: produces more ordered sequence in comparison, where you can manipulate the space between coordinates
