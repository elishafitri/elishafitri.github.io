### Week 2-3

This week, we looked at more p5 topics. Iâ€™m starting to feel more familiar with the structure. And I made a square go up!

I learnt how to declare a variable and use an if statement to create a boundary for the moving square. When the y-position of the square reaches -100px on the screen (fully disappears), the y-position moves to the bottom of the screen to start moving up again. 

This week, we learnt a range of p5 topics, including:
- print & log
- frameCount & noLoop
- variables
- colours
- iteration
- noise
- arrays

#### I learnt:
- Operators:
    - `++` is the same as x =  x + 1 (incrementing values)
    - `- -` is the same as x = x - 1 (decrementing values)
    - `%`: this is a modulo (it calculates the remainder of a quotient) which can be useful for ensuring values stay within a boundary, like a shape on the screen
- `Let` is a reassignable variable, while `const` is a variable that is immutable
