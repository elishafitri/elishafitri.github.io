## W2-3

This week, we looked at more p5 topics. Iâ€™m starting to feel more familiar with the structure. And I made a square go up!

<iframe width=400 height=442 style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" src="https://editor.p5js.org/elishafitri/full/4Bldul5xy"></iframe>

I learnt how to declare a variable and use an if statement to create a boundary for the moving square. When the y-position of the square reaches -100px on the screen (fully disappears), the y-position moves to the bottom of the screen to start moving up again.
