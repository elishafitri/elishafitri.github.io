### Ideating
Now that I had some direction with concept I was going to go with, I first made a list of all the components I would need to create the final product with some sort of idea of how I might excute it:

<img src="/images/components.jpeg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width:300px"/>
 
 <br> <br>

 ### Developing

 I first went with building the structure of the room, which was just made up of three quadilaterals. So for this I used the p5 `quad ()` shape. I also tried creating the black hole in the ground using a For Loop, where the ellipse's radii would increase at increments to create an concentric effect.

<br>

I used a similar method to create the "trail" of the room with lines instead of a shape, and ended up with these:
