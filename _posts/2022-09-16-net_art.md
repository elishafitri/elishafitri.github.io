### Ideating
Now that I had some direction with concept I was going to go with, I first made a list of all the components I would need to create the final product (with some sort of idea of how I might excute it:)

### Developing

 <br>

 I first went with building the structure of the room, which was just made up of three quadilaterals. So for this I used the p5 `quad ()` shape. I also tried creating the black hole in the ground using a For Loop, where the ellipse's radii would increase at increments for the concentric effect. An alpha fill and a light outline also helped to add some depth.

 <br>

<br>

I used a similar method to create the "trail" of the room with lines instead of a shape, and ended up with these:

<br>

For the polygons, I used a scaleFactor variable to multiply to the shape's radius. Although it may not be evenly distrubuted like the pentagon, I particularly like how the star turned out because it has that sort of illlustrative, line illusion look that I am envisioning for my concept. 

<br>
It was at this point that I realised the walls of my structure from earlier on would not be used in the final product, because I wanted to poke holes out of them. Windows!:

<br>

`beginContour()` is a really cool function that essentially cuts out a negative custom shape out of a positive custom shape.  Therefore, it can only be used in `beginShape()`. It was also important for me to note that the vertices for the negative shape would need to go around anti-clockwise for it to work.

<br>

Finally, I combined a lot of these p5 topics to create this starburst:

<br>

I created the stars as their own function, using the parameters to define their radii and vertices. For example, a skinnier, sharp-looking star would have a smaller radius1 and bigger radius2, and perhaps more vertices. I played around with these parameters and added a `rotate()` method to each one.

<br>

Next, I'll need to combine all of these components into one structure. And I still need to think about interaction and sound (I want to include both!) which will involve some mouse events.
