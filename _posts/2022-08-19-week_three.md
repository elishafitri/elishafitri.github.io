### Process
Following my initial experiments with the falling text on mouse click, I came up with a concept for the project assignment: a scavenger hunt!
  
  I came up with the idea as I was playing around with this function, thinking about how I could turn it into a simple game. In addition to this, I browsed through the RMIT Brand Guidelines document and found that the uni logo would be the perfect piece of treasure to find.
