### I <3 P5

I'm not done! (I may never be.) I've decided to continue using p5 for my third project. I've also found some other great libraries that I plan on using. I particularly love this [pattern library](https://github.com/SYM380/p5.pattern) - would be perfect for adding textures to shapes and things. I also learnt from a [tutorial by Kazuki Umeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUOweQ6wac) on how to create easy gradient effects with a custom function. I can't wait to implement these effects to create more depth in my sketches.

### Inspiration

After choosing the social platform Instagram as my CoP, I began research to start brainstorming ideas for a concept:

Here are some lovely works by inspiring designers and artists:

#### Grid Studies -- Refik Anadol
