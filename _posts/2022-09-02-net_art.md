### Brainstorming
We've been exploring a lot of new concepts in Java and p5 for our upcoming project. After being introduced to p5 in our last assignment, I found myself gravitating a lot towards organic, blobby shapes and curves. Last assignment, I discovered `beginShape()` when I was trying to figure out how to build the RMIT logo, but it only required a combination of already-existing shape primitives. For this project, I definitely want to further explore how I might incorporate my own custom shapes in my project.
  
I've decided to continue using p5 for my net art piece because I have a lot more to learn- I feel that I'm not ready to move on from it juuust yet. Here are some great things I've discovered and played around with:

Things I learnt about custom shapes!
  
  - `arc ()` is used for ellipses or parts of an ellipse. It can't be combined with other shapes
  - `curve ()` is used for connecting two points together with a small curve rather than a straight line. These can be used in shapes- in the `beginShape()` function, we can use `curveVertex()` in place of `vertex`
  - `bezier ()` are used for more complex shapes with smoother, longer curves. These can also be used in shapes - `bezierVertex ()`

<br>

After exploring concepts around vertices and curves, I created a simple test bezier editor to properly learn how they worked. The above exploration is inspired by [Simon Tiger's BeÃÅzier Editor](https://simontiger.com/bezier-editor), used to help demonstrate the way curves are created based on anchor and control points.

### Inspiration

There is some really amazing net art out there. Here are just a few works that particularly inspired by interests in this project. I was drawn to geometric shapes, random movement; definitely a lot of noise/random, and iteration, as well as colour, and varying mouse events. These are all concepts I'll look to hopefully include in my own work!

### An Idea...
Following my exploration of new concepts and inspiring works, I sat down to draw up a simple idea for my project concept:

<br>

<br>

I thought I would have a go at coding one of my recurring doodles of a floating space room. I've already started to think about how I might go about creating this concept- for example, a for loop of a custom shape for the trail of the room. I also saw a function called `beginContour` which could potentially be used to cut out windows. Along with all this I'll need to start considering what sort of interactive or sound I will include in my project.
