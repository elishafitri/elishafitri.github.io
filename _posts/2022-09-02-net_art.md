### Brainstorming
We've been exploring a lot of new concepts in Java and p5 for our upcoming project. After being introduced to p5 in our last assignment, I found myself gravitating a lot towards organic, blobby shapes and curves. Last assignment, I discovered `beginShape()` when I was trying to figure out how to build the RMIT logo, but it only required a combination of already-existing shape primitives. For this project, I definitely want to further explore how I might incorporate my own custom shapes in my art.
  
I've decided to continue using p5 for my net art piece because I have so much more to learn and I feel like I'm not ready to move on from it juuust yet. Here are some great things I've discovered and played around with:

Things I learnt about custom shapes:
  
  - `arc ()` is used for ellipses or parts of an ellipse. It can't be combined with other shapes
  - `curve ()` is used for connecting two points together with a small curve rather than a straight line. These can be used in shapes- in the `beginShape()` function, we can use `curveVertex()` in place of `vertex`
  - `bezier ()` are used for more complex shapes with smoother, longer curves. These can also be used in shapes - `bezierVertex ()`

### Inspiration

There is some really amazing work out there. Here are just a few works that particularly inspired by interests for this project. I was drawn to geometric shapes, random movement; definitely a lot of noise/random and iteration, as well as colour and varying mouse events. These are all concepts I'll look to include in my own work.
