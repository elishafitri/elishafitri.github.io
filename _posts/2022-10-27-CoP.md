<h2> Development Process </h2>  

Now that I knew how to visualise various forms of data in p5 (as documented in my <a href="https://elishafitri.github.io/creative/coding/2022/10/20/CoP.html">previous post</a>), I could begin presenting my questionnaire to my followers via Instagram. I came up with a series of questions that were relatively easy to answer:

<br>

The start of the Story included an introduction at the start and an explanation at the end for those who wanted to know what they were participating in (I created these stories in Illustrator):

<br>

After 24 hours, the results came in:

<br>

I had so much fun reading the answers that came through. Despite most of the questions being short-answer and straightforward, some answers were really quite personalised and made me feel closer to them in some ways. I truly learnt a lot about my followers, and to see what we had in common with each other. Some of the results surprised me as well- like most of my followers prefer tea to coffee?!

<h2> The Tiles </h2>

Taking these answers, I laid them out in csv files and set to work visualising the results in p5. Each question was represented in one 400 x 400px canvas, which, when posted in the feed, would connect to create one big picture in the grid. All of these 'tiles' would have a `keyPressed()` function which allows the user to save the canvas as an image when the Enter key is pressed, so it could then be easily posted. 

I wanted to have fun with visualising these results, beyond the typical methods of creating bar charts and so forth. It was a really enjoyable and important aspect of the project to allow myself to be creative with the data in front of me.
