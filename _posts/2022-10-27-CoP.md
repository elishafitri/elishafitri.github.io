<h2> Development Process </h2>

Now that I knew how to visualise various forms of data in p5 (as documented in my <a href="https://elishafitri.github.io/creative/coding/2022/10/20/CoP.html">previous post</a>), I could begin presenting my questionnaire to my followers via Instagram. I came up with a series of questions that were relatively easy to answer:

<br>

The start of the Story included an introduction at the start and an explanation at the end for those who wanted to know what they were participating in (I created these stories in Illustrator):

After 24 hours, the results came in:
