<h2> Development Process </h2>  

Now that I knew how to visualise various forms of data in p5 (as documented in my <a href="https://elishafitri.github.io/creative/coding/2022/10/20/CoP.html">previous post</a>), I could begin presenting my questionnaire to my followers via Instagram. I came up with a series of questions that were relatively easy to answer:

The start of the Story included an introduction at the start and an explanation at the end for those who wanted to know what they were participating in (I created these stories in Illustrator):

Taking these answers, I laid them out in csv files and set to work visualising the results in p5. Each question was represented in one 400 x 400px canvas, which, when posted in the feed, would connect to create one big picture in the grid. 

I wanted to have fun with visualising these results, beyond the 'usual' methods of creating bar charts and so forth. It was a really enjoyable and important aspect of the project to allow myself to be creative with the data in front of me.
